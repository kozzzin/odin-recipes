            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This silky, luscious and very classic custard can be used as the base
            for any ice cream flavor you can dream up. These particular proportions of milk and 
            cream to egg yolk will give you a thick but not sticky ice cream that feels decadent 
            but not heavy. For something a little lighter, use more milk and less cream, as long 
            as the dairy adds up to 3 cups. You can also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, 
            but don’t go below three.</p>

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Step 1</strong> In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely
                            dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks.
                            Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks,
                            then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low
                            heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
                            (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Step 2</strong> Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature.
                            Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according
                            to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store
                            in freezer until needed.
